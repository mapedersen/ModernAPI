# 🚀 Production Hosting Guide

> **Philosophy:** Raw performance and control over convenience. Self-hosted infrastructure that scales efficiently and economically.

## Why Self-Hosted VPS Over Managed Services?

This template demonstrates that **you don't need expensive managed services** to build production-grade applications. With proper architecture and automation, a single VPS can handle what companies pay thousands for on managed platforms.

### 📊 Cost Comparison (Real Numbers)

| Service | Managed (Vercel/Railway) | Self-Hosted VPS | Annual Savings |
|---------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Startup** | $20-100/month | €15/month ($18) | $240-1,200/year |
| **Growing** | $200-500/month | €45/month ($54) | $1,800-5,400/year |
| **Scale** | $1,000-5,000/month | €150/month ($180) | $10,000-58,000/year |

### 🎯 Performance Benefits

**Managed Services Path:**
```
Your Code → Platform Runtime → Cloud Function → Cold Start (100-1000ms)
```

**Self-Hosted Path:**
```
Your Code → Direct Container → Instant Response (<10ms)
```

**Real Impact:**
- ✅ **3-10x faster** response times
- ✅ **No cold starts** - always warm
- ✅ **Predictable performance** under load
- ✅ **Full control** over optimization

## 🏗️ Current Architecture
