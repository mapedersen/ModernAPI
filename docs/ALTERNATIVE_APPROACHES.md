# Alternative Architectural Approaches

This document outlines alternative patterns and approaches that could be considered for future iterations of the template, but are not implemented in the current version.

## Backend Architecture Alternatives

### Vertical Slice Architecture
- **Structure**: Feature-based folders (e.g., `/Features/Users/`, `/Features/Products/`)
- **Benefits**: High cohesion, easier to understand and modify features
- **Trade-offs**: Potential code duplication, harder to enforce cross-cutting concerns
- **When to Use**: When features are highly independent and team prefers feature-centric organization

### Hybrid Clean + Vertical Slice
- Clean Architecture for core structure with vertical slices within Application layer
- **Structure**: Clean Architecture layers + feature-based organization within Application
- **When to Use**: Large teams with complex domains requiring both separation of concerns and feature focus

## Data Access Pattern Alternatives

### CQRS with MediatR
- **Commands**: Write operations with validation and business logic
- **Queries**: Read operations with optimized data fetching
- **Benefits**: Clear separation, optimized reads/writes, easier testing
- **Trade-offs**: Additional complexity, potential over-engineering
- **When to Use**: Complex business logic, different read/write models, high-scale applications

### Direct Entity Framework with Services
- **Approach**: DbContext injection with business logic in services
- **Benefits**: Simpler, less abstraction layers
- **Trade-offs**: Tighter coupling to EF, harder to test
- **When to Use**: Simple CRUD applications, rapid prototyping

## Frontend State Management Alternatives

### React Query + Context
- **Benefits**: Powerful server state management, automatic caching, background updates
- **Trade-offs**: More complex setup, learning curve
- **When to Use**: Heavy server interaction, complex caching requirements

### Redux Toolkit (RTK)
- **Benefits**: Predictable state management, excellent DevTools, time-travel debugging
- **Trade-offs**: More boilerplate, steeper learning curve
- **When to Use**: Complex client state, need for state history, large teams

## Message Queue Alternatives

### Redis Pub/Sub
- **Benefits**: Simpler setup, good performance for basic scenarios
- **Trade-offs**: No message persistence, limited routing capabilities
- **When to Use**: Simple event broadcasting, already using Redis for caching

### In-Memory Channels (.NET)
- **Benefits**: No external dependencies, excellent performance
- **Trade-offs**: No persistence across restarts, single-instance only
- **When to Use**: Simple background processing, development environments

## Deployment Alternatives

### Kubernetes
- **Benefits**: Advanced orchestration, auto-scaling, service mesh capabilities
- **Trade-offs**: Significant complexity, resource overhead
- **When to Use**: Large-scale deployments, microservices, advanced deployment patterns

### Docker Swarm
- **Benefits**: Simpler than Kubernetes, built into Docker
- **Trade-offs**: Less feature-rich than Kubernetes
- **When to Use**: Multi-node deployments without Kubernetes complexity

## Testing Strategy Alternatives

### Playwright vs Cypress
- **Playwright**: Better cross-browser support, faster execution
- **Cypress**: Better developer experience, easier debugging
- **Decision factors**: Browser support requirements, team preferences

### xUnit vs NUnit vs MSTest
- All are viable options for .NET testing
- **Template uses**: xUnit (most popular in modern .NET)
- **Alternatives**: NUnit (feature-rich), MSTest (Microsoft's framework)

## Infrastructure Alternatives

### Monitoring Solutions
- **Self-hosted**: Grafana + Prometheus (template choice)
- **Managed**: DataDog, New Relic, Application Insights
- **Simple**: Uptime Robot + basic logging

### Database Options
- **PostgreSQL**: Template choice (open-source, feature-rich)
- **SQL Server**: If already in Microsoft ecosystem
- **SQLite**: For simple applications or embedded scenarios
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, CosmosDB for document-based data

## Evolution Path

The template is designed to evolve. Here's a suggested progression:

1. **Start**: Clean Architecture + Repository/UoW (current template)
2. **Scale Up**: Add CQRS when business logic becomes complex
3. **Optimize**: Consider vertical slicing for specific features
4. **Advanced**: Implement event sourcing for audit requirements

Each alternative approach should be evaluated based on:
- Team expertise
- Application complexity
- Performance requirements
- Maintenance overhead
- Business requirements
